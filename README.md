Project: Prediction of the six-minute walk test with gait kinematics
In this project, a better understanding of the gait parameters important for the outcome of the 6MWT, a test measuring walking distance after six minutes that is closely related to daily walking, will be investigated. In this way, therapies aimed at restoring walking function in MS and SCI patients could be better tailored.

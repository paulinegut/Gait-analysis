Project: Prediction of the six-minute walk test with gait kinematics

Three-dimensional (3D) full-body kinematic movement analysis provides objective and quantitative measures. This technique is able to unravel the individual factors underlying a given patientâ€™s gait dysfunction, even in complex neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or spinal cord injury (SCI). 3D gait analysis permits the cataloguing and processing of numerous kinematic parameters (e.g., spatiotemporal data, joint angles etc.). Today, it represents the gold standard in assessing locomotor dysfunction in humans. Such techniques are informative concerning how exactly patients move and provide more in-depth insights into complex walking dysfunctions. However, among these many kinematic parameters, there is no evidence to date as to which are the most revealing for daily walking, or more precisely, for the endurance test (6MWT).

In this project, a better understanding of the gait parameters important for the outcome of the 6MWT, a test measuring walking distance after six minutes that is closely related to daily walking, will be investigated. In this way, therapies aimed at restoring walking function in MS and SCI patients could be better tailored.
